It tells the story of death row supervisor Paul Edgecombe's encounter with John Coffey, an unusual inmate who displays inexplicable healing and empathetic abilities. The serial novel was originally released in six volumes before being republished as a single-volume work. The book is an example of magical realism. The story introduces John Coffey, a giant Black man convicted of raping and killing two young white girls. He is sentenced to death and sent to Cold Mountain Penitentiary, where he awaits his death in the death-row block E, nicknamed "The Green Mile" for the color of its linoleum floor. The block's head guard, Paul Edgecombe, is suffering from a painful urinary tract infection. One night, Coffey calls him over to his cell, grabs him through the bars, and touches his groin. Edgecombe is immediately healed. Later, Coffey also heals a terminally ill pet mouse kept by another death-row inmate, Eduard Delacroix. Coffey also helps one of the guards, Percy Wetmore, kill another prisoner, William Wharton, who turns out to have actually been the murderer of the two girls, with Coffey having tried to heal them after discovering them. Percy is committed to a mental hospital after the resulting trauma.""",

The film was written by Waldo Salt, directed by John Schlesinger, and stars Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman. Notable smaller roles are filled by Sylvia Miles, John McGiver, Brenda Vaccaro, Bob Balaban, Jennifer Salt, and Barnard Hughes. The film follows the story of a young Texan named Joe Buck (Voight), who works as a dishwasher. As the film opens, Joe dresses in new cowboy clothing, packs a suitcase, and quits his job. He heads to New York City hoping to succeed as a male prostitute for women. Initially unsuccessful, he succeeds in bedding a well-to-do middle-aged New Yorker (Miles), but Joe ends up giving her money, not vice versa. Joe then meets Enrico Salvatore "Ratso" Rizzo (Hoffman), a crippled street con man who takes $20 from Joe by offering to introduce him to a known pimp, who turns out to be a Bible thumper. Joe flees the encounter in pursuit of Ratso. Joe spends his days wandering the city and sitting in his hotel room. Soon broke, he is locked out of his hotel room and his belongings are impounded. He tries to make money by receiving oral sex from a young man (Balaban) in a movie theater. When Joe learns that the young man has no money, Joe threatens him and asks for his watch, but eventually lets him go. Joe spots Ratso and angrily shakes him down. Ratso offers to share his apartment in a condemned building. Joe accepts reluctantly, and they begin a "marriage of convenience". Joe's story is told through flashbacks. His grandmother raises him after his mother abandons him, and his grandmother takes in a lover, who sexually abuses Joe. Ratso is a tubercular street person. He dreams of moving to Miami, shown in daydream sequences throughout the film.""",

Charity Royall is a young woman who was born in the nearby mountain village of 'the Mountain', a place described as having a bad reputation, and was adopted by Lawyer Royall and his wife when she was a young girl. The story begins with Charity working as the town librarian of North Dormer. She is bored with her life and resents the charity of Lawyer Royall, who is now a widower. After meeting visiting architect Lucius Harney, Charity begins a sexual relationship with him. Charity's feelings for Harney are conflicted by her awareness of her social situation and ambiguous position in the village, and by Lawyer Royall's warnings. Lawyer Royall himself has been affected by his loneliness after his wife's death, and previously attempted to force his way into Charity's bedroom. Later, he asked her to marry him, which she declined. After Harney leaves North Dormer, Charity discovers she is pregnant. She journeys to the Mountain to seek out her mother, only to discover that her mother has just died. Distraught, and in despair over her situation, she agrees to marry Mr. Royall, who has followed her to the Mountain. The novel ends with Charity accompanying her new husband back to the hotel in nearby Nettleton, where they had gone to be married, and where she had previously spent a Fourth of July with Harney.""",

            "document": """Bleak House is a novel by Charles Dickens, first published as a 20-episode serial between March 1852 and September 1853. The novel has many characters and several sub-plots, and is told partly by the novel's heroine, Esther Summerson, and partly by an omniscient narrator. At the centre of Bleak House is a long-running legal case in the Court of Chancery, Jarndyce and Jarndyce, which came about because a testator wrote several conflicting wills. In a preface to the 1853 first edition, Dickens claimed there were many actual precedents for his fictional case. The novel follows a large cast of characters, but the main story concerns two wards of the court, Richard Carstone and Ada Clare, who fall in love despite the disapproval of their guardian, John Jarndyce. Jarndyce is the kindly master of Bleak House, where Esther lives as a companion to Ada. Lady Dedlock is the haughty mistress of Chesney Wold. The narrative follows her attempts to hide the fact that before her marriage, she had a lover, Captain Hawdon (who is now the penniless law-writer "Nemo"), and an illegitimate daughter, Esther. The novel also includes one of the first detectives in English fiction, Inspector Bucket. He investigates the murder of a lawyer, Tulkinghorn, who had been blackmailing Lady Dedlock about her past. Bucket eventually discovers that the murderer is Lady Dedlock's maid, Hortense. By the end of the novel, Jarndyce's case is resolved, but the estate has been consumed by legal costs. Richard, who had obsessively pursued the inheritance, dies, and John Jarndyce marries Esther. However, he later releases her from their engagement when she falls in love with a young doctor, Allan Woodcourt, and the two marry instead.""",

The film tells the fictional story of the first woman to undergo training in U.S. Navy Special Warfare Group. The film was produced by Largo Entertainment, Scott Free Productions, and Caravan Pictures, and distributed by Hollywood Pictures. The film centers on Lieutenant Jordan O'Neil, who is selected for training in the U.S. Navy Combined Reconnaissance Team (similar to the U.S. Navy SEALs). She becomes the first woman to undergo the rigorous training. O'Neil is determined to succeed in the CRT selection, and she initially meets with hostility and harassment from her instructors and fellow trainees. Master Chief John James Urgayle, the unit's Command Master Chief and head instructor, is particularly hard on her, believing that women have no place in Navy Special Warfare. O'Neil struggles to overcome the demanding physical requirements of the program, but she perseveres and manages to gain the respect of her fellow trainees. During a SERE training exercise, O'Neil is captured and subjected to a mock interrogation by Urgayle, who attempts to break her by using sexist tactics. O'Neil fights back and manages to strike Urgayle, impressing him with her determination. The unit is later deployed on an emergency mission to extract a team from Libya. During the mission, Urgayle is injured, and O'Neil risks her life to save him, earning his respect.
